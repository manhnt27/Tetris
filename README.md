# Tetris
* Intro: Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game. The player move the pieces(also known as 'Tetriminos'), rotate them until they reach the bottom of the board game. If the player's pieces fill up the board, this game will end.(More details on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris))
* My version: My version is a little bit different from the original game. Your task is to  remove groups of more four like-colour pieces as many as possible. It sounds like another well-known game([Bubble Shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Shooter)). There is a line on the 10th line marked for you. In the original one, you must clear lines at the bottom of the game board.   
* GamePlay: Press Left, Right, Up, Down on your keyboard to respectively move left, right, rotate and move faster. Press P to pause the programme. If you want to continue, hit P again.
* Score: You will be given 20 points at first. Each time you rotate the pieces, your penalty point is 4. Clear pieces will give you 4 points.
